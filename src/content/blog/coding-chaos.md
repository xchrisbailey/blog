## How it started

### And why we are here

My first introduction to the world of programming during the golden age of America Online. Armed with a dial-up modem and a burning curiosity, countless hours spent tinkering with script kiddie bots and dabbling in Visual Basic. While these early endeavors were often more fun than functional, they ignited a lifelong interest in coding. As the internet evolved, so did my interests. Inspired by digital artists such as 'GMunk', then my focus shifted to pixel art and web development, creating vibrant online spaces that blended creativity and technology.

## From script kiddie to indie hacker

Traded in my textbooks for a keyboard and a whole lot of caffeine. College gave me a _low level_ understanding of computer science, but the real fun began when the classroom time had run its course, and started hacking away. A self-taught wizard, conjuring up personal projects and solving problems with a mix of JavaScript, Rust, CSS, and HTML. Worked through countless frameworks, and settle on those with a React base or SvelteKit, but mostly settled on the former. No training outside of university, no fancy mentors â€“ just me, my laptop, and a whole lot of trial and error.

## The future is now-ish

**So, being \*a\* technically unemployed** developer. But wielding a laptop, a dream, and _plenty_ of free time? Embracing the life of an indie-ish hacker, diving headfirst into a few tennis-themed projects. Think of me as a digital ball boy, but instead of fetching balls, I'm building software and digital products.

From analyzing match data to developing virtual coaching tools, using my tech skills to serve up some innovative solutions for tennis enthusiasts. It is a pretty sweet gig. No boss breathing down my neck, no soul-sucking meetings, just pure, unadulterated coding.

Look, do not get it twisted. While having a blast, one day it would be nice moving on from my monotonous day job to something one can be a bit more passionate about. Until then, keep building, learning, and exploring all this space has to offer. After all, a good forehand is a good forehand, whether you're on the court or behind a keyboard.
